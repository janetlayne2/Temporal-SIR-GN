# Automorphism Calculation Code

Each of these notebooks expects to run in this folder, with the datasets found in the DATA folder. The AS dataset is too large for Github, and is found at the public Google Drive link on the main repository page. Please download it and add it to the DATA directory in order to run the automorphism calculations

**Please note** The GDELT dataset must be downloaded in accordance with the instructions found at the link provided on the main page README. That must also be placed into the DATA folder to run the GDELT automorphism notebooks. Those were separated to make them optional due to their extended runtimes.
